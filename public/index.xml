      <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, I would like to make a brief historical note in order to historicize and contextualize this text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January 27, 2024.
A few days before I published the first entry of this blog that you are reading now, the popularity of the Big Language Model (BDM/LLM) developed by the Chinese artificial intelligence company Deepseek sent shockwaves through the stocks of US technology firms. The NASDAQ, which closed without incident on the evening of Friday, January 24, saw a drop of nearly 3% on Monday, January 27, when it opened. NVDIA was the most covered company in the media, with the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the negative movement of 17% in share value. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading reports that Deepseek&amp;rsquo;s servers are being attacked, and indeed Deepseek&amp;rsquo;s BDM is not responding to its prompts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>January 27, 2024.
A few days before I published the first entry of this blog that you are reading now, the popularity of the Big Language Model (BDM/LLM) developed by the Chinese artificial intelligence company Deepseek sent shockwaves through the stocks of US technology firms. The NASDAQ, which closed without incident on the evening of Friday, January 24, saw a drop of nearly 3% on Monday, January 27, when it opened. NVDIA was the most covered company in the media, with the lion&rsquo;s share of the negative movement of 17% in share value. I&rsquo;ve been reading reports that Deepseek&rsquo;s servers are being attacked, and indeed Deepseek&rsquo;s BDM is not responding to its prompts.</p>
<p>All the while, I&rsquo;m sitting at my computer, writing my first post on my personal blog, which I started a few days ago. And in this post, I want to think about this very question. What is the point of writing a blog at the beginning of the second quarter of the 21st century, when ChatGPT, Claude, Deepseek have become writing machines? Let&rsquo;s skip that, what is the point of writing in such an age?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi! My name is Berkant Gültekin and I&rsquo;m an Analytics Engineer from Turkey. 


<img src="/images/pp.jpg" alt="berkant gültekin" height="100%" style="border-radius: 50%; float: right;width: 200px; height: 200px;"/> I&rsquo;ve always liked learning new things and exploring new possibilities and this blog is an outlet for me to create and discover new things related to Data Science.</p>
<p>I want to write posts that people can read without a technical background, but I also want to showcase and talk about the coding aspects of what I&rsquo;m currently learning, so you&rsquo;ll be able to find a little bit of everything here.</p>
<p>You can find me at:</p>
