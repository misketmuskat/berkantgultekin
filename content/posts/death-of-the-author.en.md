Visual forms are never neutral. Every diagram, chart, or image carries **cultural assumptions** about what knowledge is and how it should look. From geometry to Google Maps, people have used images not just to show information but to **organize and control knowledge**.

We must study images as **interpretive systems**, not as transparent mirrors of truth. Visual knowledge is *constructed* — shaped by values, technologies, and worldviews.
She calls for a **humanistic approach** to visualization: one that recognizes meaning as *situated and subjective*, not universal or purely mathematical.
